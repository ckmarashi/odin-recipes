# Odin Recipe Page Project
This is project is part of The Odin Project Curriculum. It follows the introduction to HTML section.

Users are tasked with creating a recipe home page which links to 3 recipe sub-pages. The sub-pages should all use the same template.

Each recipe sub-page should include a header, an image of the recipe output, ingredients and directions. The ingredients section is an unordered list while the directions are an ordered list.

I have also included a basic nutritional information section to make the page feel more complete. It was not mentioned as part of the instructions.
